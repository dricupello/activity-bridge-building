### Bridge Buildig

Made by [Adriano Cupello](https://twitter.com/londrix).

Learners will use the Internet to solve the mystery of The Kraken, a legendary sea creature, while also **learning about search terms, keywords, and how to assess the validity and relevance of web sources.**

45 minutes to an hour

### Preparation

**Complete the** [pre-activity questionnaire](http://goo.gl/forms/Uua6yKIy5E).

Next **do the activity on your own** to become familiar with it.

**Print out the** [Legit-O-Meter Worksheets](https://docs.google.com/a/zythepsary.com/file/d/0B1vyNnSVEMIDbDVLX1E4ZXRmclE/edit).

**Label three pieces of paper** with *“Real,” “Imaginary” and “Something In-between,”* and hang them on different sides of the room.

### Introduction

Have a **brief conversation with your learners about web sources.**

> * Is everything you read or watch online true?
> * How do you know when information on the internet is reliable?
> * How can you tell when it isn’t reliable?


**Then review the [Legit-O-Meter Worksheets](https://docs.google.com/a/zythepsary.com/file/d/0B1vyNnSVEMIDbDVLX1E4ZXRmclE/edit)** to discuss some general rules for determining the credibility of a website.

### Kraken the Code: Hunt

Split learners into **groups of 2 or 3** and explain that each group’s challenge is to **prove whether or not the legendary monster, The Kraken, is real or a myth.**

Groups start by **spending 20 minutes researching.** Using the guidelines from the [Tip Sheet](legit-o-meter.html), groups should **evaluate 2 internet sources**, documenting their findings on the Legit-o-Meter (either by [writing on the handout](https://docs.google.com/a/zythepsary.com/file/d/0B1vyNnSVEMIDbDVLX1E4ZXRmclE/edit) or editing [the online template](https://laura.makes.org/thimble/Mjg1NjA2NDAw/kraken-the-code-legit-o-meter)).

**Consider guiding their research** with the following prompts:

> * Ask learners to individually talk through the process of searching for credible information.
> * Do a sample search together and ask the group what to do next.
> * Pair-up learners and ask them to create a screencast explaining their decisions.

### Kraken the Code: Defense

At the end of the research period, **groups will stand under one of the signs:** “Real,” “Imaginary,” or “Something In-between”.

Ask each group what they found out about the Kraken and to **defend their opinions** using the Legit-o-Meter worksheets they filled out. Participants **can change position** if they hear convincing arguments.

Conclude by asking the group to reflect on what they found.

Complete the **[post-activity questionnaire](http://goo.gl/forms/ezm6IXWhhM)**.
